From its origins in the Mediterranean region to its widespread cultivation today, lavender, particularly *Lavandula angustifolia*, has been valued for both medicinal and aromatic uses.

### Origin and Cultivation

Lavender originated in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and parts of India. It thrives in dry, rocky terrain and sunny climates, making it well-suited to regions like the Canary Islands and parts of Europe. The plant's adaptability has led to its widespread cultivation across the world, including in Africa and Asia. Its botanical name, *Lavandula angustifolia*, points to its narrow leaves, a distinctive feature of this species.

The cultivation of lavender expanded significantly with the rise of essential oils. Its aromatic qualities and potential health benefits have made it a staple in gardens and farms. The lavender plant demands well-drained soil and benefits from regular pruning to enhance growth. Today, lavender is grown commercially in places like France, where it supports a thriving essential oil industry.

### Extraction Methods

Lavender essential oil is primarily extracted using steam distillation. This method preserves the oil's purity and therapeutic properties. During the process, steam passes through the lavender flowers, capturing the volatile oils. The steam-oil mixture is then condensed into a liquid, separating the oil from water.

Historically, lavender oil was used for its antiseptic and healing properties. Greek and Roman soldiers reportedly utilised it for treating wounds, showcasing its long-standing medicinal use. With a rising interest in natural health remedies, lavender essential oils have become even more popular, continuing a tradition that dates back centuries.
